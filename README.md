# Phonebook API
This simple application was created for the sole purpose of being a portfolio application. It serves no real world
purpose outside of this scope. The application takes the form of a NodeJS w/ TypeScript, RESTful Express API. It
integrates with MongoDB as a datasource of choice and is hosted on Heroku.
